      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">Please have a browse around and explore some of my projects / tools. The list is hopefully still growing if I haven't become lazy. Feel free to steal any of the bits you like, if you manage to find something remotely useful on here. </br> </br> On my 'Tools' page, there are multiple tools for completing tasks such as file type conversion, as well as an email extractor, and an email web scraper powershell script. If you're after more fun, check out the "Useless Projects" tab instead.</p>

    </br>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">I have designed all of the tools to use client side scripting where possible, and not upload your data to the web. All of them are available to view and download on my Github as well, so you don't have to use my website to use them if you wish to host your own instead. I decided to put these together because I was fed up of vetting all the online tools I used, to try and figure out if my data was uploaded to the internet. </p>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">On the "Useless Projects" page, I will be uploading some of the more fun ideas that come to me. These may be little games, stupid jokes, or something I have built whilst teaching myself something new. I'll try to keep it creative! </p>
