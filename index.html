      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">Please have a browse around and explore some of my projects, free tools and more! The list is hopefully still growing if I haven't become lazy. Feel free to steal any of the bits you like, if you manage to find something remotely useful on here. </br> </br> On my 'Tools' page, there are multiple tools for completing tasks such as file type conversion, as well as an email extractor, and an email web scraper powershell script. If you're after more fun, check out the "Useless Projects" tab instead.</p>

        <a class="inline-flex text-white bg-blue-500 border-0 py-2 px-6 focus:outline-none hover:bg-blue-600 rounded text-lg" href="/tools">My Tools</a>
        <a class="ml-4 inline-flex text-gray-700 bg-gray-100 border-0 py-2 px-6 focus:outline-none hover:bg-gray-200 rounded text-lg" href="/repositories">All My Repositories</a>
      </div>
    </br>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">I have designed all of the tools to use client side scripting where possible, and not upload your data to the web. All of them are available to view and download on my Github as well, so you don't have to use my website to use them if you wish to host your own instead. I decided to put these together because I was fed up of vetting all the online tools I used, to try and figure out if my data was uploaded to the internet. </p>
     <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">On the "Useless Projects" page, I will be uploading some of the more fun ideas that come to me. These may be little games, stupid jokes, or something I have built whilst teaching myself something new. I'll try to keep it creative! </p>
  </br>
  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">If you REALLY like this site, please consider hitting the donate button in the navbar. Or don't, I don't mind.</p>
  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">If you're wondering what this site will become, I plan to focus on expanding the "tools" part of it to become more useful, and to streamline the tasks that I do regularly. I also want to replace some tools I use regularly with my own, and hopefully come up with some new ones. ALl of this will be done in the client side of the browser where it can. This does mean that some tools will take a long while to process: like HEIC2JPG. But, it also means that your data is safe</p>   
  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">At current, much of my code is horribly uncommented. I plan to go back and resolve this at some point. Most likely. :p </p>
  <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed sm:text-2xl">This site is hosted through Github Pages, so you can see all of the code for everything on my Github. </p>
